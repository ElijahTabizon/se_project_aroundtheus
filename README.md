# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
In this project, there are examples of Flexbox and Grid being used. I also used responsive design so that when certain links or buttons are hovered over, there is some response. This should show how the website will appear when it is being displayed on a desktop, tablet or mobile device.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
