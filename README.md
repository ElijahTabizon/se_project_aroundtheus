**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

In this project, there are examples of Flexbox and Grid being used. I also used responsive design so that when certain links or buttons are hovered over, there is some response. This should show how the website will appear when it is being displayed on a desktop, tablet or mobile device.

To organize my code, I used proper BEM and to keep all styles in the same category that pertain to the appropriate section. For example, the parent class of "Card" is sectioned in it's own block and within that block are the child elements such as the "card**image" or "card**description".
